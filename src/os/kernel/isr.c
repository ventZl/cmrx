/** @defgroup os_isr Interrupt service routines
 * @ingroup os 
 *
 * Routines available from running interrupt service routine context.
 *
 * By default, all the interrupt service routines have higher priority than the kernel
 * service call handler. CMRX is not expecthing this to change. This configuration causes
 * that service call handler is not callable from within interrupt service handlers. 
 * Following routines are provided so that interrupt service routines can ask kernel 
 * to perform certain tasks while in servicing interrupt.
 *
 * Never perform direct calls into kernel other than methods listed in this group. These
 * methods are not reentrant and calling them from within interrupt handler may corrupt 
 * kernel internal state.
