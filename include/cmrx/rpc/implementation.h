 *
 * @brief API to create remote procedure call services and to call them.
 *
 * @section api_rpc_overview RPC mechanism overview 
 * 
 * RPC mechanism is client-server-like mechanism based on interfaces. First, the interface
 * must exist. This interface defines a range of operations that can be performed on some 
 * object. Next, any process within CMRX is free to provide an implementation of this interface.
 * Then, it can define as many objects which support this implementation as it wants.
 *
 * Any other process (even the same) - client can then call the implemented operations on 
 * the object as long as it knows the address of the object in the memory. For the client, the
 * internal structure and content of the object are opaque and inaccessible. It can only call
 * methods this object support in the implementation. The validity of call is checked
 * at compile time. The validity of pointers is checked at runtime.
 *
 * @section api_rpc_interface RPC interfaces (vtables)
 *
 * RPC interfaces are defined in a form of type definition of structures containing pointers 
 * to functions. The sole purpose of interfaces is to declare a set of operations that are 
 * available for certain types of objects. Interfaces never provide any implementation, not 
 * even default one. Interfaces shall be as abstract as the topic of the interface possibly 
 * allows. The interface may consist of any amount of functions that have following limitations:
 *  * first argument to the function call must be pointer to the object 
 *  * other than the pointer to the object, functions can have 0 to 4 arguments that must be 
 *  * integers.
 * Interfaces never contain any data members, only pointer to functions. To make the code more
 * readable, there is a helper macro to identify the pointer to object, named @ref INSTANCE().
 * A type declaration, which consists exclusively of pointer-to-function members and these
 * members follow the rules for RPC API are called vtables.
 *
 * @section api_rpc_implementation Implementation of RPC interfaces
 *
 * Each process willing to provide RPC calls - the server - has to provide an implementation
 * of these interfaces. The implementation of interface is performed by defining functions
 * having prototypes equivalent to prototypes of vtable member functions. Unlike interfaces,
 * where the pointer-to-object argument has no specific type (as the interface is abstract),
 * with implementations it is necessary to type this pointer correctly. This is second 
 * responsibility of the @ref INSTANCE() macro. During the implementation phase, it typecasts
 * the `this` pointer to correct type, so strong type safety can be achieved.
 *
 * Any amount of processes within one firmware can implement one specific interface. There is 
 * no limitation on this. One process can even provide multiple implementations of the same
 * interface, for example in case that it manages multiple objects of different type, which 
 * all provide the same manipulation semantics.
 *
 * In order to publish an implementation of some interface, a process must create a variable
 * using desired interface's vtable structure. This variable will be initialized to contain
 * pointers to functions that implement the interface. This variable **must** be defined within
 * one of process' modules and **must** be prefixed by the @ref VTABLE keyword otherwise the
 * kernel will refuse calls using such implementation for security reasons. This variable is 
 * known as vtable instance.
 *
 * @section api_rpc_objects RPC objects (services)
 *
 * After the interface has been implemented for certain process, it is possible to create 
 * structures which can be manipulated using the given interface. These services store the actual
 * data for the implementation of the interface. Object structure is thus bound with
 * the interface implementation. The only limitation given to services is that they have to 
 * contain a pointer to vtable instance, which is the first member of the structure holding 
 * service state. This will be checked at compile time and build will fail if service designer
 * fails to stick to this rule.
 *
 * @section api_rpc_instances RPC service instances
 *
 * Where RPC service is a type which provides data storage to RPC interface implementation,
 * the service instance is actual existing instance of this service. Service can't be used 
 * until instantiated. This instance can be allocated and initialized statically or dynamically.
 * There are no limitations on where the instance resides other than limitations imposed by the
 * memory protection mechanism. An instance of service translates to variable having the type
 * of RPC service.
