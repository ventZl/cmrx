/** @defgroup api_timer Timers
 * @ingroup api
 * API to interrupt, or periodically schedule execution of a thread.
 *
 * Kernel API provides two kinds of interruptions: one-time and periodic. one-time
 * interruption is always synchronous - the thread won't be given control until delay
 * elapses. Kernel is free to schedule any other thread in this time if delay is long
 * enough.
 *
 * Periodic delays are always asynchronous - the thread won't be stopped after the 
 * delay is scheduled. Once the delay elapses, kernel will deliver a signal to the 
 * requesting thread. If thread has nothing to do until the delay elapses, it may
 * stop itself via calling @ref kill() using @ref SIG_STOP signal.
