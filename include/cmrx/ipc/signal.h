/** @defgroup api_signal Signals
 * @ingroup api
 * API for sending signals and handling incoming signals.
 *
 * Threads can send signals asynchronously to each other. Kernel provides
 * mechanism to register signal handler, which gets executed whenever thread
 * receives a signal. There are two kinds of signals:
 *
 * * catchable - kernel supports sending of 32 distinct catchable signals. Kernel
 * doesn't interpret any of them in any way. If such signal is sent to the thread
 * then thread is simply notified of its arrival.
 * * non-catchable - these signals are mostly system-defined and thread is not
 * able to catch nor react to them. These include stopping and resuming thread,
 * killing it and signalling memory protection violation error.
 *
 * If thread doesn't register any signal handler, then signal arrival is effectively
 * a no-op for given thread. In any case, arrival of signal will wake thread up,
 * if it is stopped.
