/** @defgroup api Kernel API
 *
 * Public API for userspace code to interface with the kernel.
 *
 * This API provides access to all services of the CMRX RTOS and covers all callbacks CMRX 
 * might have into integrators's code. This API is designed to be cross-platform compatible
 * and from the userspace point of view, it is presented as functions that can be called.
 *
 * For certain purposes, mainly for customization, CMRX might require integrator to provide
 * some callbacks that CMRX can call. These callbacks are also cross-platform compatible and
 * allow the integrator to customize some basic services such as clock source and power
 * management.
